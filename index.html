        <h2>What Are Cyber Threats?</h2>
        <p><b>In the 1950s</b>, the word “cyber” used to refer to cybernetics – the science of understanding the control and movement of machines and animals. This was followed by <b>“cyber”</b> standing for <b>“computerized.”</b>
            The <b>1990s</b> brought around a new cyber-related term. The word <b>“cyberspace”</b> emerged to define an invented physical space that some people wanted to believe existed behind the electronic activities of computing devices.
            <b>Cyber threats in the modern day</b>
            Today, the term is almost exclusively used to describe information security matters. Because it’s hard to visualize how digital signals traveling across a wire can represent an attack, we’ve taken to visualizing the digital phenomenon as a physical one.
            A cyber attack is an attack that is mounted against us (meaning our digital devices) by means of cyberspace. Cyberspace, a virtual space that doesn’t exist, has become the metaphor to help us understand digital weaponry that intends to harm us.
            What is real, however, is the intent of the attacker as well as the potential impact. While many cyber attacks are merely nuisances, some are quite serious, even potentially threatening human lives.</p>
